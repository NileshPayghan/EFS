Encrypting File System (EFS) 

This file system creates and original files into the encrypted format
with the public and private key using the different kind of algorithms

so while encryping the data we have to careful about the changing the original data
and decrypting the ecrypted data

1. First Encrypt the single character with the single key

2. Second Enecrypt the character array with the single key and decrypt the array again
	same array used do not store result into another array

3.Third one is create an Chacter array and takes multiple keys and encrypt the Character array

4.Next is Take data as well as it's private key and encrypt data by its private key
	and decrypt the data by using it's private key.

5.take the name of the file from user and ecnrypt that file in place and decrypt that file in place with single key then use multiple key
